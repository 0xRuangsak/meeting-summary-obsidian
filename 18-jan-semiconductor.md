# Meeting Summary: Semiconductor Industry Discussion

---

## Semiconductor Chain Overview

The semiconductor manufacturing process consists of three stages, ordered from lowest to highest complexity and value:

| Stage | Industry Term | Description | Complexity |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **[[Back-End]]** | [[BEOL]] (Back-End-of-Line) | Assembly, packaging, and testing | Low |
| **[[Middle-End]]** | [[MEOL]] (Middle-End-of-Line) | [[Advanced Packaging]], die stacking, wafer-level integration | Medium |
| **[[Front-End]]** | [[FEOL]] (Front-End-of-Line) | [[Wafer Fabrication]], transistor and circuit creation | High |

### Thailand's Position

- **[[Back-End]] ([[BEOL]]):** [[Thailand]] already has established capabilities in this segment, but it generates the lowest value in the chain.

- **[[Middle-End]] ([[MEOL]]) / [[Advanced Packaging]]:** This is an emerging field driven by demand for [[3D Chip Stacking]] and [[Heterogeneous Integration]]. It represents a potential opportunity for [[Thailand]] to enter a growing market segment.

- **[[Front-End]] ([[FEOL]]):** [[Thailand]] missed the opportunity to develop [[Wafer Fabrication]] capabilities. With global leaders already operating at sub-5nm nodes, entering this segment now would require enormous investment with limited competitive advantage.

### Emerging Technology: [[Silicon Photonics]]

[[Silicon Photonics]] is an emerging trend that replaces traditional copper interconnects with optical solutions, offering higher reliability and performance. This could represent a new opportunity area.

## Current Situation Analysis: [[4M 1E Framework]]

### [[Man]] (Human Capital)

**Challenges:**
- [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] tend to prioritize hiring their own nationals, creating barriers for Thai engineers seeking experience abroad.
- Some private sector companies have addressed this by sending Thai engineers to [[Taiwan]] for training, who then return to build local teams.
- A significant [[Knowledge Gap]] exists between [[Academia]] and [[Industry]]. University curricula are largely outdated; the most transferable skill from formal education is logical thinking rather than specific technical knowledge.

### [[Machine]] (Equipment)

**Observations:**
- [[Japan]] leads in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Most Taiwanese fabs use Japanese machinery.
- [[Ajinomoto]] ([[Japan]]) is a major supplier of [[ABF Substrate]] materials, a critical component in [[Advanced Packaging]].
- [[Japan]] is actively expanding its semiconductor industry support and could be a strategic partner.

### [[Material]] (Supply Chain)

**Challenges:**
- Current [[BOI]] (Board of Investment) regulations require materials to be imported from abroad.
- This creates inefficiencies: two firms located near each other in [[Thailand]] must ship equipment to [[Malaysia]] and back just to satisfy import requirements for material transfer.

### [[Method]] (Industry Capability)

**Observations:**
- Some Thai firms have demonstrated capability in industrial-grade semiconductor manufacturing and automation.
- However, a large number of semiconductor businesses in [[Thailand]] have gone out of business.

### [[Environment]] (Ecosystem)

**Challenges:**
- A [[Knowledge Gap]] persists between [[Industry]] practitioners and policymakers who need this knowledge to make informed decisions.
- Major global semiconductor conferences shape industry direction and attract key players, but [[Thailand]] lacks meaningful participation in these forums.

## Policy

### [[Man]] (Human Capital)
- Establish [[G2G Agreement]] (government-to-government) with [[Taiwan]] to send Thai engineers and engineering students for training and industry exposure.
- Encourage and support Thai engineers to attend major international semiconductor conferences.

### [[Machine]] (Equipment)
- Develop strategic partnerships with [[Japan]]. As [[Japan]] faces an [[Aging Society]], [[Thailand]] can offer a younger workforce and room for growth, creating mutual benefit.

### [[Material]] (Supply Chain)
- Reform [[BOI]] regulations to eliminate inefficient import requirements.
- Create [[Sandbox Environment]] to improve communication and operational links between domestic businesses.

### [[Method]]
*No specific policy recommendations were discussed.*

### [[Environment]] (Ecosystem)
- [[ASEAN]] represents significant untapped potential for semiconductor demand.
- [[Data Centers]] continue to drive semiconductor demand growth and could anchor regional industry development.
