# Whole chain of semiconductor

Backend >> middle >> frontend

while we can sort by complexity

frontend : wafer >> need sophiscitated tech to do it
for thailand context : thai choose not to ride the wave and joining this is not make sense, a whole world can do below 5nm joining today would waste time and resource and it's not worth it

middle : collecting the wafer together
actually this is new field because the new wave require semiconductor to have 3 phases insead of front and back thi spart might need to join wafer together

backend : skrew bolt and nuts
this is the most part that has least value thailand already have it

optic semiconductor is a new trend to go for : normal have problems with copper wire/ optic is more reliable


# current situation about semiconductor

4M 1E

Man
- there is current blocker that mainland china/taipei china would secure the job to their own
-- there is a way that private sector tackle this such as sending people to taiwan and come back to contribute to the current team
- The knowledge gap in the academic and industry is too wide, any knowledge in university might not be useful


Machine
- japan(ayinomoto) is the leader of machine that making the semiconductor (most of taiwan environment use machine from japan)
- actually japan is going to support a semiconductor industry and japan might be a great partner

Material
- BOI in thailand require that material in thailand should import from foreign country >> lead to an action that not make sense(two firm that close together must transport machine to malaysia before send it back ti thailand just to transfer the machine)

Method
- some of thai firm can do a industrial grade semiconductor/automation but most of business is die

Environment
- there is still gap between people who knows and people who should know
- there is conference that direct the world trend and major companies/ major player join this conference but thailand does not

# policy for semiconductor 

Man
- send thai engineer/ engineering student to taiwan with g2g agreement
- encourage thai engineer to go to conference

Machine
- partner with japan >> japan is entering aging society >> thailand still has cheap labor and a room to growth

Material
- change the BOI rules// create sandbox environment to improve the communication link and interaction between business

Environment
- ASEAN still has a huge potential for semiconductor demands and datacenter still being the demand feeder of semiconductor sys
